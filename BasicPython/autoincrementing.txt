Exercise
Create a books table that has an auto-incrementing id column.

Other columns:

title

author_name



Then, add 3 rows of data without providing a value to the id column so that SQLite generates the values for us.



Solution


The complete solution is also available as a db fiddle.



First, we should create the table. Making the id column auto-incrementing in SQLite is as simple as making it a primary key since it then becomes an alias for ROWID:

CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, author_name TEXT);


Then we insert the data, making sure to not give values to the `id` column:

INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Clean Code', 'Uncle Bob');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Fluent Python', 'Luciano Ramalho');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Introduction to Algorithms', 'Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein');
