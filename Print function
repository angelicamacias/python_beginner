The syntax for **print** function command is:		
'''rudy 
  print("Hello yellow cat")
'''

The arguments to a function are between parentheses the line is delimited with quotes, and a value betewwn quotes is called a **string**.

The PRINT FUNCTION proviedes this possibilities:

If we want to print multiple lines at once, we can do so by invoking multiple print 
functions
	print(";lsakjdf")
	print(";lfjkdas")

There can not be more than one instruction on a line in python 

If we want to print a longer sentence taht should be separated with n- ew lines,
we can use the newline caracter "\n"
	
	print("Hello yellow \ncats")
		Hello yellow 
		cats 
keyword argument:
 
-end 
	print("Hello!, end="")
	print("yellow cat")
	
	Hello! yellow cat 

This keyword argument determines the characters that the print functions sends 
to the output once it reaches the end of its positional arguments. Lines were printed
on the same line. 

-sep 

With sep we can control the how python separates the outputted arguments
which is just a space by default. 

	print("Hello!, "yellow", "cat", sep="-")
	
	Hello!-yellow-cat 

The same way we can cobining these the arguments and keywords for have 
the string that we want it:

	print("Hello, end="!"\n)
	print("yellow cat", sept=WW, "end= :)")
	
	Hello! 
	yellowWW cat:) 

ABSTRACT:
-Built-in functions: can be used without importing it.
-Allows us to print values to the console.
-We can invoke it with parentheses. 
-We can pass the value we want to print as arguments between the parentheses. 
-The backslash \ tells python that the next character has a special meaning (eg. \n).
-Keyword arguements such as sep and end can be used to format the output.
